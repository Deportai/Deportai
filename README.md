## **🌍 Introduction**
Welcome to **DeportAi**, he sick AI that's about to change the game in how we deal with those sneaky illegal Mexicans. This bad boy is all about getting those who shouldn't be here, outta here, FAST! Sending those mexicans directly through the portal to mexico under el trumpos supervision!  

This project explores the boundaries of decentralized databases and patriotic values, helping us take back our jobs and showing every local mexican in your area!

## **🛠️ Core Features**
- **🌍 Gravitational Validation Nodes**  
  Transactions are prioritized and validated based on their gravitational "weight," leveraging Einstein’s field equations.  

- **⏳ Temporal Anchors**  
  Transactions are anchored in spacetime, ensuring stability and preventing timeline discrepancies.  

- **🔒 Quantum-Resistant Cryptography**  
  Future-proofing blockchain security against quantum attacks across all dimensions.

- **🚀 Multiversal Compatibility**  
  Enables seamless cross-universe transactions validated through quantum entanglement.  


## **💡 How It Works**
### Gravitational Validation Formula
Transactions are validated using Einstein's gravitational equation:
```javascript
function validateBlock(mass, distance) {
  const GRAVITATIONAL_CONSTANT = 6.67430e-11; // Universal constant
  return GRAVITATIONAL_CONSTANT * mass / (distance ** 2);
}
```

### Temporal Anchoring
Every transaction is timestamped and anchored in spacetime:
```javascript
function calculateTemporalAnchor(block) {
  const speedOfLight = 299792458; // m/s
  return block.timestamp * block.mass / Math.sqrt(1 - (block.velocity ** 2 / speedOfLight ** 2));
}
```

### Multiversal Validation
Using quantum entanglement, blocks are validated across parallel timelines.

## **📈 Roadmap**
1️⃣ **Q1 2025**: Deploy gravitational validation nodes on Earth.  
2️⃣ **Q2 2025**: Launch quantum-safe staking mechanisms.  
3️⃣ **Q3 2025**: Introduce OneRock Token Wormholes for ultra-fast cross-timeline transactions.  
4️⃣ **Q4 2025**: Expand gravitational nodes to lunar and Martian surfaces.
